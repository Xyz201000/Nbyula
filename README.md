For creating the test plan we will follow the following steps: Analyze the product Design the Test Strategy Define the Test Objectives Define Test Criteria Resource Planning Plan Test Environment Schedule & Estimation Determine Test Deliverables

Step 1) Analyze the product How can you test a product without any information about it? The answer is Impossible. You must learn a product thoroughly before testing it.

The product under test is Guru99 banking website. You should research clients and the end users to know their needs and expectations from the application

You should take a look around this website and also review product documentation. Review of product documentation helps you to understand all the features of the website as well as how to use it. If you are unclear on any items, you might interview customer, developer, designer to get more information Step 2) Develop Test Strategy Test Strategy is a critical step in making a Test Plan in Software Testing. A Test Strategy document, is a high-level document, which is usually developed by Test Manager. This document defines:

The project’s testing objectives and the means to achieve them Determines testing effort and costs Step 2.1) Define Scope of Testing Before the start of any test activity, scope of the testing should be known. You must think hard about it.

The components of the system to be tested (hardware, software, middleware, etc.) are defined as “in scope“ The components of the system that will not be tested also need to be clearly defined as being “out of scope.” Defining the scope of your testing project is very important for all stakeholders. A precise scope helps you

Give everyone a confidence & accurate information of the testing you are doing All project members will have a clear understanding about what is tested and what is not Step 2.2) Identify Testing Type A Testing Type is a standard test procedure that gives an expected test outcome.

Each testing type is formulated to identify a specific type of product bugs. But, all Testing Types are aimed at achieving one common goal “Early detection of all the defects before releasing the product to the customer”

Step 2.3) Document Risk & Issues Risk is future’s uncertain event with a probability of occurrence and a potential for loss. When the risk actually happens, it becomes the ‘issue’.

In the article Risk Analysis and Solution, you have already learned about the ‘Risk’ analysis in detail and identified potential risks in the project.

In the QA Test Plan, you will document those risks

Step 2.4) Create Test Logistics In Test Logistics, the Test Manager should answer the following questions:

Who will test? When will the test occur? Who will test?

You may not know exact names of the tester who will test, but the type of tester can be defined.

To select the right member for specified task, you have to consider if his skill is qualified for the task or not, also estimate the project budget. Selecting wrong member for the task may cause the project to fail or delay.
